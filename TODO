[x] Find better defaults for the material you specification (it sucks rn)
[x] Cache the palettes generated in Rust. The cache could be a map from a hash to
    the palette, and the hash would be generated from the path to the image + its last edition date
    (the Rust code is responsible for 96% of the time required to set the colorscheme)
[-] Add an option to get the wallpaper in end-4's hyprland dotfiles config
    (needs to be tested)
[x] Add an actual build script to the recommended lazy.nvim spec
[x] Provide precompiled binaries for the shared rust library and setup a way to download it (like blink.cmp does).
    It's only 2 Mb on Linux, neat.
[0] Define a user command for reloading the theme if the wallpaper changed, or with a color/path-to-image passed as argument
    (Useless actually, the theme reloads on its own on colorscheme command)
[x] (If possible) create separate themes auto-theme-light and auto-theme-dark that ignore vim.o.background
[x] Fcking document the options

[ ] Long term (requires interested users that can test it): test wallpaper finding on GNOME and Cinnamon,
    implement it for COSMIC, XFCE and maybe other desktops + Windows and MacOS
